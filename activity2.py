                    <h1> Recreation </h1>
                    <p>



                    One of my hoppies is riding bikes. I rod my bike on many trails
                    and my favorite is the Wabash trail located in Iowa. Every year
                    Iowa held the biggest bike ride Nation wide which called 
                    RAGBRAI, I have been on this ride twice in the last two
                    years and this year I finsihed 500 miles.  
                    . Another thing I like to do during my free time is outdoor Ice 
                    skate at two of my favaiort places which are Cunnigham lake 
                    and Manawa Lake. Unfortunatly Cunnigham lake is under constraction and it's frasturating not being able to enjoy the lake.
